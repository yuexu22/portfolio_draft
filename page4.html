	In late 2018, I got an internship in a new city and made new friends. 
	The people are nice and friendly, and there are a lot of events during 
	the weekend. We would go climbing mountains and boating, which was so fun!

	I went to California during Christmas. I love the beaches and the sun, 
	and I can spend the whole day there. 
	I love the lifestyle of people in California, and the weather is nice. 
	We visited UC Irvine and enjoyed the beautiful campus there. It is such a good year with good memories.
